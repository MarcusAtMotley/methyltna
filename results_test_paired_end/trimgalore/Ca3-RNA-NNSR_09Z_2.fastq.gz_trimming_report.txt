Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
2-colour high quality G-trimming enabled, with quality cutoff: --nextseq-trim=20
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Output file will be GZIP compressed
